# Development of OpenSlides 4

## First time checkout

After cloning the repository you need to initialize all submodules, before you can start the development setup

    $ git submodule update --init
    $ make run-dev

## Running tests

To run all tests of all services, execute `run-service-tests`. TODO: Systemtests in this repo.

## Adding a new Service

    $ git submodule add <git@myrepo.git>

Append `branch = master` to the new entry in the `.gitmodules` file. Verify,
that it is there (the folder should have 160000 permissions: Submodule) with the
current commit:

    $ git diff --cached

Than, commit changes and create a pull request.

## Work in submodules

- Create your own fork at github.
- Remove the upstream (main) repo as the origin in the submodule:
    $ cd <submodule>
    $ git remote remove origin

- Add your fork and the main repo as origin and upstream
    $ git remote add origin <your fork>
    $ git remote add upstream <main repo>

## Requirements for services

### Environment variables

These environment variables are available:

- `<SERVICE>_HOST`: The host from a required service
- `<SERVICE>_PORT`: The port from a required service

Required services can be `MESSAGE_BUS`, `DATASTORE_WRITER`, `PERMISSION`, `AUTOUPDATE`,
etc. For private services (e.g. a database dedicated to exactly one service),
use the following syntax: `<SERVICE>_<PRIV_SERVICE>_<ATTRIBUTE>`, e.g. the
Postgresql user for the datastore: `DATASTORE_POSTGRESQL_USER`.

### Makefile

A makefile must be provided at the root-level of the service. The currently
required (phony) targets are:

- `run-tests`: Execute all tests from the submodule
- `build-dev`: Build an image with the tag `openslides-<service>-dev`

## Developing on a single service

Go to the serivce and create a new branch (from master):

    $ cd my-service
    $ git status  # -> on master?
    $ git checkout -b my-feature

Run OpenSlides in development mode (e.g. in a new terminal):

    $ make run-dev

After making some changes in my-service, create a commit and push to your fork

    $ git add -A
    $ git commit -m "A meaningful commit message here"
    $ git push origin my-feature

As the last step, you can create a PR on Github. After merging, these steps are
required to be executed in the main repo:

    $ cd my-service
    $ git pull upstream master
    $ cd ..
    $ git diff  # -> commit hash changed for my-service

If the update commit should be a PR:

    $ git checkout -b updated-my-service
    $ git commit -am "Updated my-service"
    $ git push origin updated-my-service

Or a direct push on master:
    $ git commit -am "Updated my-service"
    $ git push origin master

## A useful command

After working in many services with different branches, this command checks
out `master` (or the given branch in the .gitmodules) in all submodules:

    $ git submodule foreach -q --recursive 'git checkout $(git config -f $toplevel/.gitmodules submodule.$name.branch || echo master)'
